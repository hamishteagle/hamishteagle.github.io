Several new techniques were used in this paper. We implemented new, dedicated secondary vertex finding to identify soft b-jets and dedicated ML models
targeting compressed sbottom and dark matter scenarios.

My personal contributions:
>- I was co-leader for this paper
>- Development of the ML model (code, training, validation and implementation) for the semi-compressed regions
>- Overall analysis design for the sbottom regions
>- Responsible for running the statistical analysis for the sbottom regions
