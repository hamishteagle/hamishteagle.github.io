This was the first LHC physics I worked on! I started on the project in the summer of my 3rd year undergraduate whilst on placement at CERN, I
continued the project for my master's thesis which lead to publication in the 1st year of my PhD.

This paper is the first dedicated LHC targeting $\widetilde{b} \rightarrow h \widetilde{\chi}^0_2 \rightarrow \widetilde{\chi}^0_1$ signature and the
first to explore mass hypotheses with $\Delta m(\widetilde{\chi}^0_2, \widetilde{\chi}^0_1)$=130GeV.

My personal contributions:
>- Development of the combinatorical algorithms to reconstruct higgs decays forming the basis of the analyses
>- Development of the approach for the compressed scenario using an ISR jet selection and adapted reconstruction algorithms
